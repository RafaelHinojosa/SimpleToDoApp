## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Building this app was adquiring a lot of **new** information, so it was a challenge to get familiarized with the syntax (because I don't know Java), 
understand the process and the code. 

Another challenge was that the version of Android Studio used in the video tutorials had some changes with mine and I had to discover how to fix those 
differences, in order to get a correct solution of the app.

Finally, I challenged myself by reading all the code again, writing more but significant comments and deciding to implement the extra feature where the user 
cannot leave blank spaces.
